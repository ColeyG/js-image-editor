# JS Image Editor

This is a simple JS image editor created for MMED-6000

## Getting this Started

**For demonstration & marking I have set this up at the url: [URL HERE]**

Otherwise, if you'd like to set this up locally, execute the following steps:

- `npm i`: Install all dependencies
- change the `remote` constant in main.js to `localhost`
- `npm run-script dev: to re-compile
- `node server.js`: Start the image handling server
